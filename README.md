# pong-game
Created a simple Pong game in Python using the Turtle module. The game includes two paddles, a ball, and keeps track of the score. Players can control the paddles using 'w' and 's' keys for one player and the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for the other player. The game features boundary checking for the ball and paddle collisions, making it an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience.
